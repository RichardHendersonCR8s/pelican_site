Summary: Analyzing the hiking trails at Red Rock Mountain.

Over the past few years I've started hiking more and more frequently. As someone who mainly works inside,
often times from the comfort of their home, hiking gives me a chance to get some fresh air and experience
the great outdoors. The city I grew up in, Las Vegas, is surrounded by mountain spots. A byproduct of that
fact is that there's tons of hiking spots. I've never been the type of person that was super interested in clubs or partying, so hiking is easily my favorite part about my home city.
