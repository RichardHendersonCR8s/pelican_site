Hey all! Welcome to my website. For the most part, I wanted to keep things simple here. For the most part, this website is separated into three seconds.

1. The Blog
2. Projects and NoteBooks
3. The About page.

That's it! Everything is pretty self-explanatory. My blog will include any writing I'll be doing, short or long. Topics will be focused on the varied realm of Data Science. Second is my Projects and Notebooks section. This will include...You guessed it! Projects and Notebooks! These will likely be in the form of a Github or Kaggle link. Lastly, the About section will have information about me, Richard Henderson.

For those wondering what I'm using to create this blog, it was made with the help of the [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) Python library. Currently, I'm using a slightly modified version of the [Flex theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) for styling. Hosting from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) made this process pretty easy. When I first learned Python, I once followed [Miguel Grinberg's world-famous Flask tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) to make a blog. However, that's another story to tell. The main point is that Pelican is really easy to use.

Anyways, thanks for reading this and for visiting my humble website. If you need to reach out to me for any reason, my contact info can be found on the about page.

Thanks,
Richard Henderson
