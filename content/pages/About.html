        <p> Welcome visiter! As you've probably already realized, my name is Richard Henderson. I'm an motivated, up and coming Data Analyst looking to gain experience and continue my path in life long learning.
        I earned a Bachelors of Arts in Sociology degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.   </p>

        <p>Since has far as I can remember, I've always been interested in the Social Sciences. Trying to answer the "Who, What, Where, and How" of our human race continues to bring me joy, even after completing my undergrad. Often times data is at the center of the answers to these questions. It can be used to tell stories, dispute hypothesis, and summarize the behavior of a target group. My goal is to bring this same sense of wonder and curiosity to your business. </p>
