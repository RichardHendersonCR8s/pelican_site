        <p> Welcome visitor! My name is Richard Henderson. I'm a motivated, up-and-coming Data Analyst looking to gain experience and continue my path in lifelong learning. I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>

        <p>
For as far as I can remember, I've always been interested in the Social Sciences. Searching for patterns and asking questions about our society still intrigues me daily. Data is often at the center of the answers to these questions. It helps us tell stories, support hypotheses, make predictions, and more. Utilizing Data Analytics and Data Science, I hope to bring this same sense of wonder and curiosity to your business.
